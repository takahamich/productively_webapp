**Code Review**

For the code review portion, we spent some time reviewing our codebase removing duplicate code, unnecessary files and comments, renaming variables to have more informative variable names, and remodeling our databases. We have assigned each member a task to complete as seen below:

**Shaina: **Handling code deletion of all files related to login.** **Improving database models to get rid of extraneous data

**Ayo:** Handling code deletion and extraneous comments as related to calendar and task.js setup. Includes deleting packages like socket.io, removing unnecessary import statements, and  updating package.json with the right dependencies.

**Michiko:** Handling the refactoring of folders and file structure for all routes in our server folder.

**Keidai:** Working on fixing errors when searching for users and not finding them (instead of throwing an error when no user is found, displaying an error that the user isnâ€™t found), handling deleting readme template files, updating readme to reflect new updates and instructions while running our application, finished resources page.

**Nolan:** Standardizing database format so that contents of database are the same across the board. Improving security with database access.

**Weina:** Cleaning up index.js and all files related to the scheduling algorithm, getting rid of yarn file and deleting extraneous console.log.
