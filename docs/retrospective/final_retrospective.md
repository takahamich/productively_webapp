REFLECTING ON ITERATION 5

While we delivered in most of our goals for iteration 5, we encountered a few set backs.

**What challenges did we have?**
- Rushing at the deadline
- Miscommunication 

**How can we improve in the next iteration to do a better job?**
- Offer help to teammates when we feel like we completed our task fairly easily
- Continue communicating with each other
- Openly discuss contribution efforts
- Follow the deadlines we set for ourselves better
- We want everything to be done early enough so that we are not rushing to finish everything on the last day.
- Text check-ins
- Zoom meet ups



FINAL RETROSPECTIVE: REFLECTING ON FALL 2021 WITH m.OOSE

Looking at our original project proposal, my oh my, were we ambitious! We were multiple software versions ahead of what we have now. To be fair, we accomplished a lot, and delivered on a good amount of what we said we would do. We made a fully working calendar, a fully interactive system that adds tasks to the calendar, created a multiplier to help users see the difference between their expected and actual time spent on tasks, had a page with useful resources, employed a beautiful design to easily navigate between pages, and even made use of Google API to login google users. 

Simultaneously, we weren’t able to get to implementing notifications, upload the course schedule automatically to the calendar, connect with different calendar platforms, get more consistent multiplier analyses and recommendations during usage, allow users to connect day to day tasks to broader life goals, and some more. 

Not reaching our original goals wasn’t our only challenge. We also realized that people problems are harder than technical problems: it wasn’t always easy working together, working with people of varying levels of self-awareness and communication skills, and handling everyone’s unstandardized levels of trust. However, after every iteration, we reflected as a group with activities like “I like… and I wish…” to say what we liked and wished other people did, openly, and together. We also learned to recognize the varied strengths of different team members. For example, had a solid power dynamic with Keidai and Ayo with different forms of leadership. Shaina and Michiko were extremely adaptable and flexible all around. Nolan was more knowledgeable with the backend. Weina was best on independent algorithmic tasks. Thankfully, we had a team with very diversely skilled teammates and varying personalities. 

If I could go back in time and start again at iteration-1, Keidai would have still chosen his teammates the same way (he recruited everyone and put the team together, even though no one knew each other before this class). He interviewed all of us – over Zoom and in writing – about who we were as people, teammates, and even had us do a coding interview with him. We ended up choosing each other mostly because we seemed diligent, responsive, but also because we could become potential friends. Working towards a potential friendship made us a much better team than just a team of people solely based on credentials, and there was no rush to try to find a large quantity of people: quality was exponentially more important. The teamwork reflections we had every iteration were difficult, but now looking back, much needed. It helped us recognize what made each of us talented and special. We hope that our relationships in m.OOSE won’t just end here.
