Our goal for iteration 1 was to create the task field --allow users to view a calendar and submit a task without worrying about the aesthetic.
We were able to create a view of the calendar, but were not able to deliver the task creation part of our iteration. We were able, however to create a priority drop down assignment.

What we did well: Set up our environment and deciding on our architecture. Without much experience, we were able to make some advancement. 

How we can improve next iteration: 
- Use and expand on the foundation we were able to build.
- Be more realistic about our goals; we underestimated how much learning we would have to do in the first iteration.
- Plan our time more effectively: meet with each other, set deadlines for each other. 
  -  So assign tasks according to everybody's schedule -- especially since certain tasks need to be done before others can work on a different task.
- Let the team know early if we're not able to make a deadline.
- Work on our communication: give updates on our progress, and rely on each other for help when stuck.
- Find a once-a-week time to meet.
- Make sure to move tasks to "done" section in project board once completed.
