What we got done: this iteration, we were able to deliver on everything we intended to do.
- Updated the Calendar View
- Created an "add task button," which flies out on click and allows the user to see a form to fill out task
- Made the "create a task" form
- Styling & Formatting the Webpage
- Created the log in page for the web-app, which redirects to calendar view on submit
- Switched our database to mongo db
- Set up framework for database 


What we have not delivered / lacked planning: 
- We didn't do much back-end work; which we want to focus more on in the next iteration.

Challenges we had: 
- Communication
- Juggling React's new and old version -- consistency in coding.
- Researching and finding correct information

Plan for improvements:
- Individual tasks instead of paired tasks
- Deadlines and more detailed schedule
- Create individual branches for each team member
