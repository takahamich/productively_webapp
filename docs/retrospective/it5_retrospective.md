While we delivered in most of our goals for iteration 4, we encoutered a few set backs.

**What challenges did we have?**
- Rushing at the deadline
- Miscomminution 

**How can we improve in the next iteration to do a better job?**
- Offer help to teammates when we feel like we completed our task fairly easily
- Continue communicating with each other
- Openly discuss contribution efforts
- Follow the deadlines we set for ourselves better
- We want everything to be done early enough so that we are not rushing to finish everything on the last day.
- Text check-ins
- Zoom meet ups
